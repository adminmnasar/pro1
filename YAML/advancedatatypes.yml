 if we are writing list it has to be in sequence. 

 example. 

 students: !!sequence 

 - Name
 - Roll number 
 - marks

 #another methood  

 subjects: [Urdu, telugu, english, maths.]

 # some of the keys of the sequnces will be empty. 

# sparse seq. 

sparse seq:

 - hi 
 - how 
 - are 
 -

 - null
 -sup 

 #to represent sub items of the list we have to do sub sequesnce.

 #nested sequesnce 

-
 - mago 
 - apple 
 - banana
-
 - marks
 - roll
 - data

 # key  value pairs are called maps. 

 !!maps
 # nested maps means map in maps. 

 name: nasar 
 roles: {age: 24, job: IT}

 # pairs : keys may have duplicate values. 

 #This will be an array of hashtable. 

 pair example: !!pairs [job: IT, job: devops]

 #set will allow you to have unique values. 

 names : !!set

  ? kunal
  ? vivek
  ? vishwata

# if we want to represent sequence as a value then we have to use dictionary !!omap
people: !!omap
